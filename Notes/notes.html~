Syntax of CSS rule
Selector
Declaration
Property/Value Pair

Element Selector 
Let's lear this with an example:

p{
color: blue;
}

This will give blue color to every paragraph

Class Selector

.blue{
color: blue;
}

<p class="blue">...</p>
<p>..</p>
<div class="blue">..<div>
...

ID selector

#blue{
color: blue;
}

<p class="blue">...</p>
<p>..</p>
<div id="blue">..<div>

Grouping Selectors

div, .blue{
color: blue;
}

<p class="blue">...</p>
<p>..</p>
<div>..<div>

So above will apply blue color to paragraph and every div in that file.

p.big {
	font-size: 20px;
}

<p class="big">....</p>
<div class"big">..</p>

text withing <p> will get font-size 20 while text withing div will not.

Child Selector

selector > selector 

selector followed by another selector

for an Example

article > p
{
	color: blue;
}

<article>
<p>...</p> ->text wil affect with above css
</article>

<p>...</p> -> text won't affect with above css

<article>
<div><p>..</p></div> -> text won't affect with above css
</article>


article p
{
	color: blue;
}

<article>
<p>...</p> ->text wil affect with above css
</article>

<p>...</p> -> text will affect with above css

<article>
<div><p>..</p></div> -> text will affect with above css
</article>

css will apply to <p> with any level untill it's inside <article>



.colored p {
	color: blue;
}

Every p inside an element with class="colored"

article > .colored {
	color: blue;
}

Every element with class="colored" that is direct child of article element.
