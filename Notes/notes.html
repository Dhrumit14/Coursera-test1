						It's always good idea to define <title> attribute for <a> tag.

Semantic Html element 
The element which tells you something about the content.
wheather it's little bit of description or wheather it's importance. 
Basically hints to you to that meaning.
May help search engine ranking.
Help human to better understand the structure of the page.
Help Computer to better understand the structure of the page


List 
It simply allows you to group related content.
Text aren't allowed in UI tag without using LI tag.

Istead of followig characters 
< > &

We ca use
<    >     &
&lt; &gt; &amp;

&nbsp is very usefull for nonbreaking space.

if you change the view selection in browser from default to any other 
for example: use &quote for "

Links
If defined links are in a same directory then it's good to use title like "same dir link" or something.

External link
always defined with starting of https://

ALways remeber to define width and height

It's always good idea to define <title> attribute for <a> tag.

Syntax of CSS rule
Selector
Declaration
Property/Value Pair

Element Selector 
Let's clear this with an example:

p{
color: blue;
}

This will give blue color to every paragraph

Class Selector

.blue{
color: blue;
}

<p class="blue">...</p>
<p>..</p>
<div class="blue">..<div>
...

ID selector

#blue{
color: blue;
}

<p class="blue">...</p>
<p>..</p>
<div id="blue">..<div>

Grouping Selectors

div, .blue{
color: blue;
}

<p class="blue">...</p>
<p>..</p>
<div>..<div>

So above will apply blue color to paragraph and every div in that file.

p.big {
	font-size: 20px;
}

<p class="big">....</p>
<div class"big">..</p>

text withing <p> will get font-size 20 while text withing div will not.

Child Selector

selector > selector 

selector followed by another selector

for an Example

article > p
{
	color: blue;
}

<article>
<p>...</p> ->text wil affect with above css
</article>

<p>...</p> -> text won't affect with above css

<article>
<div><p>..</p></div> -> text won't affect with above css
</article>


article p
{
	color: blue;
}

<article>
<p>...</p> ->text wil affect with above css
</article>

<p>...</p> -> text will affect with above css

<article>
<div><p>..</p></div> -> text will affect with above css
</article>

css will apply to <p> with any level untill it's inside <article>



.colored p {
	color: blue;
}

Every p inside an element with class="colored"

article > .colored {
	color: blue;
}

Every element with class="colored" that is direct child of article element.
	

Pseudo classBest
	
	Link
	Visited
	hover
	active
	nth-child
	
Link:
	Links arent easy to design like other elements.
	Links have states that can be express using pseudo classes.
	
	for example:
	a: link; 	a: visited;
		|			|	
	one state	second state
	
a:hover -> used to change color when hovering the mouse.
a:active -> used to keep hover effect untill you release the click. -> important
	
Important element:nth-child
	defied using below example.

<header>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://goo.gl/V0Wl6s" target="_blank">AngularJS Course</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/CourseraWebDev" target="_blank">Facebook Fan Page</a></li>
  </ul>
</header>
	
if you want to change anything related to facebook link which 3rd child of ul given above.
	use-> header li:nth-child(3){
				font-size: 40px;		
		  }

You can use odd and even with nth-child as well
	for example: nth-child(odd)
				 nth-child(even)
	

Style Placement
	
	you can also apply style directly inside the tag using style="text-align: centre;"
	
for external stylesheet 
	<link href:"style.css">
	

	
Some Rule
	
	origin
	merge
	inheritance
	spcificity

merge:
	define some css in external link and define some css in same html file. if defined css within same html file will
	overide external css if it's same and remained effects of external css will be the same.
	
Inheritance

Specificity -> important
	style""		ID			class,pseudo class,attibute			# of Elements
	
so it's totaly depends on above ranking which css will apply. 
	
Important example of specificity
	
header.navigation p {
  color: blue;
}
p.blurb {
  color: red;
}
p {
  color: green !important;  -> what ever the score will be counted if css is applied withing this type of specific tag then that will apply first
}								although the score of p is 1 which is less then both of above defined css 12 and 11 respectively. 
	
Styling text
	For text style always try to use "font-family" as you can't not rely on what kind of browser client is using.
	For color #0000ff;
			   R G B
	Font-weight is alsow useful you can give range from 100 ... 900 .. bold. It's very useful for font thickness.

Important

<style>	
body {
  font-size: 120%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div>Regular text</div>
<div style="font-size: 2em;">2em text
  <div style="font-size: 2em;">4em text
    <div style="font-size: .5em;">2em again!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</body>
	 
	
Here in above example you can see that for inner font-size we have use "em" which is basically used for the font unit.
	2em used in second div basically double the size of "2em text" based on Regular text used in first div.
	Same way 4em text will be double based on "2em text".
	While "2em again" will be same as "2em text" as we have used font-size: .5em.
	
The Box Model

Some times it's better to give padding: 0px and Margin: 0px
Because sometime browser by default sets some margin, so you will see some space at the beginning and ending of the sentence. 

	
Important notes

Once you will define width for box for an example:

#box {
 background-color: blue;
 padding: 10px;
 border: 5px solid black;
 margin: 40px;
 width: 300px;

}

The width of the original box won't be the 300px, it will be 330 which is equal to width + 2 sides border + 2 sides padding.
So because of this reason css3 has given a new feature “box-sizing: border-box” which will give total 300px width to the box.
See example below:

#box {

 background-color: blue;
 padding: 10px;
 border: 5px solid black;
 margin: 40px;
 width: 300px;
 box-sizing: border-box

}
